Migrations - classes are generated by EF and shouldn't be edited by hand:
[***]Init file - specifies migrations that entity framework must perform to create a specific database
[***]ModelSnapshot file - this class saves current state of database, so the future migrations
can be generated by comparing this class with DbContext class


Address.cs, Dish.cs, Restaurant.cs - data model
RestaurantDbContext.cs - connection to database through Entity Framework 


DTO - Data Transfer Object - type created strictly for communicating with a client
In order to use DTO properly it's necessary to use mapping:
* manual mapping can be difficult to manage, so here we use AutoMapper (the one with dependecy injection)


Controller:
- shouldn't contain a lot of logic
- controller's actions should receive a request (and it's validation)
- controller's actions should send a request to a service for further handling of these requests

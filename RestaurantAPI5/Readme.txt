Migrations - classes are generated by EF and shouldn't be edited by hand:
[***]Init file - specifies migrations that entity framework must perform to create a specific database
[***]ModelSnapshot file - this class saves current state of database, so the future migrations
can be generated by comparing this class with DbContext class


Address.cs, Dish.cs, Restaurant.cs - data model
RestaurantDbContext.cs - connection to database through Entity Framework
